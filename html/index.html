            <p>In the late 1990s, a startup named Netflix emerged in the competitive entertainment market. Initially, Netflix's business model revolved around mailing DVDs to customers, a novel concept at the time. The company faced a significant challenge: how to efficiently manage and distribute a growing library of DVDs to a rapidly expanding customer base.

            In the early stages, Netflix carried less than a thousand DVD titles. With a daily shipment volume of twenty to thirty, their operations were manageable without advanced technology. However, the introduction of their no-due-date, no-late-fees program led to an explosion in popularity. The subscriber count soared to 250,000, and the DVD library expanded to nearly 10,000 titles. Netflix had to adapt quickly.</p>
                
            <p>With a need for an innovative solution, Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph and an early Netflix employee explored the idea of automated DVD rental kiosks in high-traffic areas, such as grocery stores and shopping malls. Embracing the concept of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), they opted for a hands-on approach. Rather than pouring millions into developing a sophisticated vending machine, they set up a simple, manned kiosk in a bustling supermarket. This makeshift setup focused primarily on direct interaction with customers and gathering immediate feedback on their new distribution method. This approach allowed Netflix to gauge the feasibility and reception of its idea quickly and effectively, staying true to its ethos of agile adaptation and customer-centric innovation.</p>
                
            <p>After their supermarket kiosk experiment, Netflix decided not to pursue the idea further. However, Mitch Lowe, the Netflix employee also responsible for the initial test, took the concept and ran with it. He later founded a company you might have heard of - RedBox - turning the once humble supermarket test into a widespread success story of automated DVD rentals.</p>
